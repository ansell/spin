TopBraid SPIN API 1.2.0 (2011-05-31)

- Feature: Follows latest SPIN spec, with SPARQL 1.1 support
- Feature: Support for the new spin:eval function
- Bug fix: AbstractTriplesVisitor ran into infinite loop with recursive function calls
- Bug fix: Inference engine now reacts on progressMonitor canceled
- Bug fix: Various fixes related to non-sp:arg arguments in function calls
- Change:  Renamed Let to Bind (also in sp namespace - sp:Let will still work though)
- Change:  Performance improvements in SPIN RDF->SPARQL conversion through cache
           Note that this cache assumes that SPIN RDF structures are stable, so that
           the same SPIN RDF node will always produce the same SPARQL query/expression.
           The cache can be switched off (ARQFactory.setUseCaches).


TopBraid SPIN API 1.1.2 (2010-09-17)

- Feature: Added further SPARQL 1.1 support to SPIN RDF Syntax
           - COALESCE
           - FILTER EXISTS
           - FILTER NOT EXISTS
           - IF
           - IN
           - IRI
           - MINUS   
           - NOT IN      
- Feature: SPIN functions can now take argument with any predicate, not just sp:arg1 etc.
           In textual notation, the alphabetic ordering of property local names is used.
- Feature: Added magic property spl:relevantPropertyAtClass
- Bug fix: SPIN RDF syntax did not handle project expressions such as (?x AS ?y)
- Bug fix: Rewrote template instantiation code by printing query with pre-bound variables
- Bug fix: Rendering of ORDER BY ?x did not work if ?x had an rdf:type



TopBraid SPIN API 1.1.1 (2010-03-28)

- Feature: Generalized aggregations support including AVG, MIN and MAX
- Feature: SPIN syntax support for SELECT project expressions (expr AS ?var)
- Feature: Magic properties now only compute values on demand (use a QueryIterator)
- Feature: Constraint violations now also include spin:violationSource
- Feature: API support for SPIN Result Sets (http://spinrdf.org/spr.html)
- Bug fix: Rendering of rdf Lists (magic property calls) was sometimes wrong 
- Bug fix: Subproperties of spin:constructor were not always recognized
- Bug fix: Now supporting variables in SERVICE keyword


TopBraid SPIN API 1.1.0 (2009-10-??)

- Feature: Support for user-defined spin:MagicProperties
- Feature: SPARQL UPDATE (INSERT INTO, DELETE FROM, MODIFY) now supported by
           SPIN RDF syntax (see org.topbraid.model.update)
- Feature: Control rule execution order with spin:nextRuleProperty and
           spin:rulePropertyMaxIterationCount
- Feature: Support for spin:fix on constraint violations
- Feature: Support for spin:thisUnbound to control performance
- Bug fix: Instances of subclasses of spin:Function were not recognized as functions
- Bug fix: Indentation of solution modifiers of nested SELECT queries was incorrect
- Change:  Moved to Jena 2.6.2 and ARQ 2.8.1
- Change:  Moved JenaUtil class to util package
- Change:  Removed support for spin:ruleIndex.  Instead, lexical order is used.
- Change:  Introduced support for subclasses of spin:Template, so that templates
           can also point to Update requests.  This required some API changes.


TopBraid SPIN API 1.0.2 (2009-08-11)

- Bug fix: User-defined SPARQL function calls crashed (with false) if an argument
           was an unbound variable.
- Bug fix: SPIN RDF Syntax now supports COUNT(DISTINCT...) aggregations
- Bug fix: SPIN constructors did not create SPINExplanations
- Change:  Now requires Jena 2.6 or above
- Feature: Added support for ARQ's SERVICE keyword to SPIN RDF Syntax
- Feature: Added support for ARQ's NOT EXISTS keyword to SPIN RDF Syntax
- Feature: Support for the new property spin:imports.
           This property can link a file with another file that contains
           constraints, such as http://topbraid.org/spin/spinowl for OWL
           constraint checking, without having to import all of SPIN etc. 


TopBraid SPIN API 1.0.1 (2009-06-14)

- Bug fix: rdf:type has been abbreviated with "a" at object and subject positions
- Bug fix: Initialization of SPL functions did not handle spin variable names 
- Feature: SPIN RDF syntax now supports SubQuery
- Change: SPL/SP/SPIN.getModel() more tolerant against running API from source code

TopBraid SPIN API 0.9.0 (2009-03-06)

- First public release, with AGPL license


System Requirements:
